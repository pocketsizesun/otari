# Models

Otari routes requests to LLM providers through [any-llm-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/any-llm-sdk/). This page covers the model format, supported providers, and capabilities.

## Model format

Models are specified as `provider:model_name`:

```
openai:gpt-4o
anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6
mistral:mistral-large-latest
vertexai:gemini-2.0-flash
```

The `provider` prefix tells Otari which backend to route to. The `model_name` is passed directly to that provider's API.

## Supported providers

Otari depends on `any-llm-sdk[all]`. Provider support can change as the SDK evolves.

Use this list as a quick reference for common providers supported by the current Otari build.

## Capabilities

Not all providers support all endpoints. Here's what each endpoint type requires:

| Endpoint | Capability | Example providers |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| `/v1/chat/completions` | Chat completion | Most providers |
| `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages API | Anthropic, Vertex AI Anthropic |
| `/v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses API | OpenAI |
| `/v1/embeddings` | Text embeddings | OpenAI, Cohere, Voyage, Vertex AI |
| `/v1/moderations` | Content moderation | OpenAI |
| `/v1/rerank` | Document reranking | Cohere |
| `/v1/images/generations` | Image generation | OpenAI, Vertex AI |
| `/v1/audio/transcriptions` | Audio transcription | OpenAI |
| `/v1/audio/speech` | Text-to-speech | OpenAI |
| `/v1/batches` | Batch processing | OpenAI, Anthropic |

In deployments connected to otari.ai, the final model/provider choices are resolved by otari.ai routing policy, not by local `providers` configuration.

## Configuring a provider

In `config.yml`:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    api_key: "sk-..."
    api_base: "https://api.openai.com/v1"  # optional for hosted OpenAI
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Both approaches work for routing: a provider whose native credential environment
variable is set (for example `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) is callable as
`provider:model` even without a `providers` entry. Config file values take
precedence over environment variables.

Discovery is narrower. `GET /v1/models` lists only the providers in the
`providers` block (plus anything added at runtime through the Providers page), so
a provider that is callable through its environment variable alone is not listed
until you configure it. Add the entry to have its models discovered:

```yaml
providers:
  anthropic:
    api_key: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
```

In standalone mode, provider config only tells Otari how to reach the backend.
Otari also requires pricing for the model you call by default, unless
`default_pricing` covers it or `require_pricing: false` is set.

For the full configuration reference, see [Configuration](configuration.md).

## Named provider instances

The `providers` map is keyed by instance name. Most of the time that name is
also the provider, such as `openai` or `anthropic`.

If you want to use multiple backends that share one provider implementation,
give one of them a custom name and set `provider_type`. This is common for
self-hosted OpenAI-compatible servers such as vLLM, llama.cpp, or LM Studio:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:                       # key is a real provider, no provider_type needed
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}

  home_lab:                     # custom instance name
    provider_type: openai       # underlying any-llm implementation
    api_base: "https://nathans-mac-studio.example.ts.net/v1"
    api_key: ${HOME_LAB_TOKEN}
```

Route to a named instance with `instance_name:model`. For example,
`home_lab:deepseek-v4-flash` uses the `home_lab` config, but Otari sends the
request through the OpenAI provider implementation with that instance's
`api_base` and `api_key`. `openai:gpt-4o` still uses the regular `openai`
config.

Pricing and usage are keyed on the instance name, so configure pricing under
`home_lab:deepseek-v4-flash` if you want that model to be priceable. If you do
not set `provider_type`, the key works as before and names the provider
directly.

`provider_type: openai-compatible` and `provider_type: openai_compatible` are
both accepted as aliases for `openai`.

Named instances are a standalone-mode feature. In hybrid mode, provider
credentials come from otari.ai per request, so local named instances are not
used.

### Declaring models for backends without `/v1/models`

`/v1/models` lists an instance's models by calling the backend's model-listing
endpoint. When a backend does not expose `/v1/models`, declare the served model
ids so they still appear in the listing:

```yaml
providers:
  edge_box:
    provider_type: openai
    api_base: "https://edge.example.ts.net/v1"
    api_key: ${EDGE_TOKEN}
    models:
      - llama-3.3-70b
      - qwen3-32b
```

The declared `models` are listed as `edge_box:<model>`. Direct requests work
with or without this list; it only affects discovery.

## Local providers

Ollama, llama.cpp, and llamafile need no credential at all, so there is no
environment variable that could signal one is in use, and Otari never dials a
localhost port on spec. Routing works regardless: with a local server running,
`ollama:llama3` is callable straight away, with no configuration.

Discovery is what needs the entry. To have a local backend's models appear in
`GET /v1/models`, name it in the `providers` block. There is nothing to put under
the key, so a bare entry is enough:

```yaml
providers:
  ollama:
```

Otari then calls the backend's model-listing endpoint at its default address
(`http://127.0.0.1:11434` for Ollama, which also honors `OLLAMA_HOST`, and
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` for llama.cpp and llamafile) and lists what it finds
under the instance name, so an `ollama` entry yields `ollama:<model>`. Point at a
non-default address with `api_base`:

```yaml
providers:
  ollama:
    api_base: "http://gpu-box.example.ts.net:11434"
```

If the server is not running, discovery reports it as unreachable rather than
listing anything; the failure is cached briefly, so an offline local server does
not slow down every request. For a local backend that serves no model-listing
endpoint, declare the ids with `models:` as shown above.

A bare entry naming a provider that *does* need a key (`openai:` with nothing
beneath it) loads too, but Otari logs a warning at startup when no credential is
configured for it and its environment variable is unset, since that shape is
usually a truncated edit rather than an intentionally keyless instance.

## Model aliases

An alias is a display name that maps to a real selector, so you can expose a
friendly, stable model name and keep the underlying provider/model hidden.
Aliases are configured in a top-level `aliases` map (display name to target):

> An alias is the one-target case of a [routing policy](routing.md). Everything
> below still applies; reach for a policy when you want failover, a
> budget-based tier-down, or a guardrail the caller cannot skip.

```yaml
aliases:
  myopusmodel: anthropic:claude-opus-4
  fastmodel: openai:gpt-5
  housemodel: home_lab:qwen3     # target may be a named instance
```

A request whose `model` is an alias routes to its target. The alias is what
callers see:

- `GET /v1/models` lists the alias id (and `GET /v1/models/{alias}` resolves it),
  with pricing read from the target so the real price shows without revealing the
  model. Aliased entries report `owned_by: otari`.
- The response `model` field (streaming and non-streaming) is relabeled to the
  alias, so the underlying model name never appears on the wire.

Alias routing is applied wherever a model selector is resolved, so an alias is
accepted on every model-taking endpoint. The response `model` field is relabeled
on `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/messages`, `/v1/responses`, `/v1/embeddings`,
`/v1/moderations`, and `/v1/rerank`. Other surfaces (`/v1/images`,
`/v1/audio/*`, `/v1/batches`) route aliases but return the provider payload as-is;
those payloads carry no `model` field today, so nothing leaks, but a provider that
started returning one would echo the target rather than the alias.

Pricing, budgets, and usage logs key on the resolved target, not the alias:
configure pricing once for `anthropic:claude-opus-4` and every alias pointing at
it inherits that price. An alias with no pricing on its target fails closed under
`require_pricing`, exactly as the real model would.

To expose only your curated alias names, set `model_discovery: false` so the full
provider catalog is not listed; the listing then shows just the aliases, plus any
models you priced explicitly that no alias points at. Pricing an alias target does
not republish it: the alias entry already carries that price, so pricing a target
never puts the hidden name back in the listing. Whether real models are listed is
governed by `model_discovery` alone. With discovery on, aliases appear alongside
the discovered models, including any target you aliased.

A [routing policy](routing.md) does **not** withhold its targets, which is where it
parts company with an alias. The policy name is listed as its own entry, and every
selector it can reach stays in the catalogue as itself. Withholding them was tried
and reverted: a policy can name up to five selectors (its head plus an `on_failure`
chain), so one failover policy could empty most of a catalogue, and a candidate
priced by the [genai-prices fallback](configuration.md) then disappeared from the
dashboard together with its rate. `GET /v1/models/{key}` never withheld them
either, so nothing was really being kept off the wire.

If you do want a model reachable only under a curated name, that is what an alias
is for. Use `otari routing explain` or the dashboard's Routing page to see which
policy sends traffic where.

Constraints, checked at startup: a target must be of the form `instance:model` or
`provider:model` whose prefix is a configured instance or a known provider; an
alias name must not contain `:` or `/` (a selector-shaped name would silently
reroute requests for the real model) and must not collide with a provider
instance name; and an alias target must not be another alias (no chaining).

Like named instances, aliases are a standalone-mode feature. In hybrid mode model
resolution and routing are owned by the otari.ai platform, so the local `aliases`
map does not apply.

### Runtime aliases, and scoping one to a user

Aliases can also be created without a restart, through `/v1/aliases` (master key
only) or the dashboard's Routing page, which lists and manages aliases alongside
[routing policies](routing.md). A runtime alias means the same thing to a
request as a configured one; it is stored in the database rather than in
`config.yml`, and the listing tells you which is which (`source: config` or
`source: stored`).

A runtime alias applies to every caller by default. Give it a `user_id` and it
applies to that user alone:

```bash
# Global: everyone resolves "fast" to gpt-5-mini.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/aliases \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <master-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "fast", "target": "openai:gpt-5-mini"}'

# Scoped: alice alone resolves "fast" to a local model instead.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/aliases \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <master-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "fast", "target": "home_lab:qwen3", "user_id": "alice"}'
```

Scoping is what lets one stable model name mean different things to different
callers: point a team at a cheaper model, pin one user to a specific version, or
migrate people onto a new target a few at a time, all without any caller changing
the `model` they send.

The rules that follow from it:

- Resolution is most-specific-first: a user's own alias wins over a `config.yml`
  alias, which wins over a global stored one. So a user-scoped alias may override
  a configured name (that is a working override), while a *global* stored alias
  may not (config would win, and the stored one would silently never be used, so
  the API refuses it with a 400).
- A name plus a scope is the identity. Creating `fast` for `alice` leaves the
  global `fast` alone, and deleting either leaves the other in place. Deletes take
  the scope as a query parameter: `DELETE /v1/aliases/fast?user_id=alice`, or omit
  it for the global one.
- `GET /v1/models` is scoped the same way, so a caller sees the global and
  configured aliases plus their own, never another user's. `GET /v1/aliases` is
  the master-key management view and lists every scope at once.
- Target-hiding follows the scope. A global alias hides its target from
  everyone's listing; a user-scoped one hides it from that user's listing only, so
  another caller may still see the real model (subject to their own model access).
  If you are using aliases to curate one catalogue for everybody, keep those
  aliases global.
- That rule inverts when a user-scoped alias overrides a **`config.yml`** name.
  The override replaces the configured entry for that user, so the configured
  target is no longer among the names being withheld and it reappears in that
  user's catalogue. Overriding `myopusmodel` for one user therefore un-hides
  whatever `myopusmodel` pointed at, for that user only, and still subject to
  their model access. It takes a master key to arrange, so it is not a leak, but
  it is the opposite of what the previous bullet leads you to expect.
- Listing and dispatch scope on different things for a master-key caller.
  `GET /v1/models` scopes on the API key's user, while a request scopes on the
  billed user. For any ordinary key those are the same. For the master key they
  are not: a chat request with `"user": "alice"` resolves alice's scoped aliases,
  but `GET /v1/models` with the master key shows none of them, because the master
  key has no user of its own. That is the exact sequence for checking a scoped
  alias after creating it, so verify it with the user's own key, or by sending a
  request, rather than by reading the master-key listing.
- `user_id` must name a live user. An unknown id is a 404, and so is a deleted
  one: a deleted user cannot authenticate, so the alias would never resolve.
- Pricing still keys on the resolved target, so a scoped alias inherits its own
  target's price. And `POST /v1/pricing` rejects any name that is an alias to
  anyone, scoped or not: such a row could never be read.

Scoping is per user, not per API key. A key inherits its user's aliases, so
several keys belonging to one user resolve the same names.

## Listing available models

Query Otari to see which models are available:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>"
```

## Provider-specific notes

### Pinning a HuggingFace inference backend

HuggingFace Inference Providers is a router: the same model id (for example
`zai-org/GLM-4.6`) can be served by several backends (Together, Novita, and
others), and in the default "auto" mode the backend, and therefore the price,
is chosen at request time. To route (and price) deterministically, pin a
backend with a `:<backend>` suffix on the model id, which the HuggingFace
router honors server side:

```text
huggingface:zai-org/GLM-4.6:together
huggingface:zai-org/GLM-4.6:novita
```

The pinned-selector grammar is `huggingface:<model>:<backend>`. Otari splits
the provider off the first `:`, so everything after it (`<model>:<backend>`) is
forwarded as the model id and the `:<backend>` suffix reaches the router
unchanged. The router also accepts policy suffixes such as `:cheapest`,
`:fastest`, `:preferred`, and `:auto`.

This grammar is the contract consumers build against. The otari.ai platform's
pricing UI, for instance, offers each priceable backend as a pinned
`huggingface:<model>:<backend>` selector, because a pinned selector resolves to
a single backend, which is what makes a HuggingFace model priceable (auto mode
cannot be priced from the model id alone).
