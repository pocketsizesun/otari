"""In-process registry of the requests the gateway is currently serving.

A usage row is written when a request *settles*, so the activity log can only
ever describe the past. On a slow backend (a local model answering in 30 seconds
or more) that leaves the operator with nothing to look at while the request is
actually running. This module holds the other half: what is in flight right now.

Two deliberate properties:

* **In-memory, per process.** Nothing is persisted and nothing is shared between
  processes, so a deployment running several otari processes behind a load
  balancer reports only the requests the answering process is serving. Persisting
  would mean a write per request on the hot path to record something that is stale
  a second later.
* **Removal is owned by the middleware, not the handler.** A streaming response
  outlives its route handler (the body is produced after the handler returns),
  and the settlement paths that write usage rows branch a dozen ways. The one
  place that always runs exactly once per request is the ASGI middleware's
  ``finally``, which is where the entry is dropped. This mirrors how the
  ``gateway_active_requests`` gauge is kept honest in :mod:`gateway.metrics`.

The entry map is therefore not capped: an entry's lifetime is a request's
lifetime, so its size is bounded by real concurrency. The read endpoint caps
what it serializes instead, and reports the true count alongside it.
