"""Anthropic Messages API variant of the MCP tool-use loop.

Mirrors :mod:`gateway.services.mcp_loop` but speaks the Anthropic wire shape:
``content`` blocks instead of ``tool_calls``, ``tool_use`` / ``tool_result``
blocks, ``stop_reason == "tool_use"`` as the round-continuation signal.

The loop skeleton itself lives in :mod:`gateway.services._tool_loop`; this
module supplies the Anthropic strategy and thin public wrappers.

The duck-typed pool interface (``owns_tool`` / ``call_tool`` /
``openai_tools`` / ``purpose_hints``) is reused unchanged; the
``openai_tools`` shape is converted at the boundary in :mod:`tool_format`.
