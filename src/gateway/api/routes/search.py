"""Search pass-through endpoint: a direct, billed search request.

``otari_web_search`` answers a model's tool call mid-completion. This endpoint
is the standalone counterpart: the caller asks, the gateway asks the search
provider, and the result comes straight back, having gone through the same
auth, rate limit, budget reservation, and usage log as a completion. It exists
so a client that proxies a search API can keep one gateway on the billing path
instead of holding a second provider key of its own.

The request and response follow LiteLLM's ``/v1/search`` (itself shaped after
Perplexity's Search API), so a caller moving off the LiteLLM proxy keeps its
request shape; :mod:`gateway.services.search_backend` translates to and from the
provider's native shape and owns the per-provider adapters. Two Perplexity
features are deliberately not modeled: ``query`` is a single string rather than
the multi-query array, and the filters with no field below (recency, context
size, published-date) are ignored rather than rejected. Both are called out in
``docs/api-reference.md`` so a migrating caller can check for them.

Both the body-selected (``POST /v1/search``) and path-selected
(``POST /v1/search/{search_tool_name}``) forms log ``endpoint="/v1/search"``,
so one Activity filter covers every search regardless of how the tool was
named.

A request the gateway itself turns away (an unknown or ambiguous tool name, a
tool the caller's key may not use) writes a usage row too, through the shared
:func:`gateway.api.routes._pipeline.log_gateway_rejection` the pass-through
routes use: refused traffic is dropped traffic, and it should be visible in
Activity and countable as a failure rather than invisible outside the caller's
own logs.

Billing: search is priced per request, not per token, so a usage row carries
zero tokens and a cost taken from the provider's own reported charge when it
reports one. Otherwise the cost is the flat per-request rate configured for
``<provider>:<tool>`` under the same convention moderations uses
(:func:`flat_request_cost`). Like moderations and audio, search is exempt from
``require_pricing``: a provider that reports its own cost is metered whether or
not a rate is configured, so failing closed would reject calls the gateway can
bill precisely.
