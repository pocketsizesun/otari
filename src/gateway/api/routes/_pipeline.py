"""Shared request-pipeline core for the chat / messages / responses routes.

The three completion-style endpoints speak different wire formats but run the
same pipeline: authenticate (platform resolve or local key + budget pre-debit),
apply input guardrails, extract gateway-managed tools, dispatch to the provider
(directly or through a tool-loop backend), and settle the budget reservation
when the request finishes. This module owns that pipeline once; each route
supplies a small :class:`FormatAdapter` for the format-specific edges (request
parsing, SSE chunk shape, error envelope, provider call, tool loop).

Settlement invariants owned here:

* ``reserve_budget`` happens in :func:`resolve_request_context` (standalone
  mode only); every downstream success path reconciles via
  :func:`reconcile_reservation` and every failure path refunds via
  :func:`refund_reservation`, including streaming completions, streams that
  end without usage data (``stream_missing_usage_policy``), client
  disconnects, and pre-stream dispatch failures.
* The streaming settlement callbacks (``on_complete`` / ``on_no_usage`` /
  ``on_error`` / ``on_incomplete``) are built in exactly one place,
  :func:`build_streaming_response`, and are wired identically for the
  single-attempt and platform-fallback paths of every format.
* Backend open semantics: sandbox and web_search backends open eagerly so an
  unreachable backend surfaces as an HTTP 502 before the 200 OK header; the
  MCP pool opens lazily inside the stream generator (single-attempt paths) or
  eagerly on an ``AsyncExitStack`` shared across attempts (platform fallback).
* Every gateway-side rejection that reaches a known user records an error row
  via :func:`log_gateway_rejection`, so refused traffic is visible in the
  activity log and countable by the dashboard's failure count instead of
  vanishing. That function documents which rejections deliberately do not log.

    Gateway-side rejections used to raise without writing anything, so an
    operator had no way to see that live traffic was being dropped: the activity
    log showed nothing and the dashboard's failure count read 0 for the duration
    of the incident. The row carries ``status="error"`` (what the count and its
    drill-down read) and no cost, so it makes the drop visible and countable
    without ever moving spend or the budget.

    Callers own the reservation: refund it before calling this, exactly as the
    pre-existing rejection sites do. Nothing here touches the budget.

    ``status_code`` is the status the caller is about to return, and it is
    required rather than optional: a rejection row without one classifies as
    ``unknown`` in the failure taxonomy (``errors_by_status_code``), which is
    indistinguishable from a pre-column historical row. It is always statically
    known here, since these are the gateway's own refusals rather than upstream
    faults, so there is nothing to infer from an exception.

    ``counts_toward_budget`` is always True. The dashboard classifies
    ``counts_toward_budget=False`` rows as imported usage and offers them for
    bulk delete and set-price, which must never happen to a row the gateway
    wrote itself. There is no cost on these rows for the flag to gate, so
    pinning it True is safe even for a key flagged ``exclude_from_budget``.

    Some rejections deliberately stay unlogged, and for three different reasons.
    An authentication failure (401) is refused before any user is known: the
    column is nullable, so a NULL-user row would insert fine, but it could not be
    attributed, acted on, or filtered, and writing one would let an
    unauthenticated caller append to the usage table. ``user_id=None`` is
    therefore a no-op here. A 404 for a user that does not exist is skipped for a
    harder reason: ``usage_logs.user_id`` is a foreign key to ``users``, so that
    row could not be inserted at all. A rate-limit rejection (429) is skipped
    because a throttle is expected, self-limiting behavior rather than dropped
    traffic; the client-driven gates that do log (a selector that no longer
    resolves, a model outside an allow-list) are neither self-limiting nor
    expected, which is why the asymmetry is deliberate.

    Every gate that does log sits behind ``check_rate_limit``, so the rows a
    single key can append are bounded by its user's RPM. The one gate that fires
    earlier, the user/key mismatch, charges the bucket itself through
    :func:`throttle_early_rejection` to keep that bound.

    Writing the row is best-effort. Every caller logs and then re-raises the
    rejection it was already going to return, so an exception escaping here
    would replace a clean 403 or 400 with a 500 and make an unhealthy log writer
    look like a broken gateway to the client. Observability must not change the
    response contract, so a failure is swallowed and reported to the gateway log
    instead. ``SingleLogWriter`` already absorbs ``SQLAlchemyError`` itself, so
    what this catches is the rest (session setup or teardown, a writer whose
    queue is gone). Nothing leaks by dropping the row: every call site refunds
    its reservation before calling this, never after.

    """Standalone-mode non-streaming dispatch with reservation settlement.

    Success applies the rate-limit headers to ``response``, writes the usage
    log (per the adapter's no-usage policy), and reconciles the reservation
    against actual cost; every failure path refunds the reservation before
    mapping the error to the format's wire envelope.

    ``display_model`` (a configured alias) relabels the result's ``model`` field
    before returning, so the underlying provider/model stays hidden; billing and
    logging above still key on the resolved target ``model``/``provider``.

    When ``ctx.plan`` holds more than one candidate (the caller named a routing
    policy with an ``on_failure`` chain) the dispatch walks them, and
    ``provider`` / ``model`` / ``display_model`` are rebound to whichever
    candidate actually served. Settlement below is untouched: it stays the single
    place a reservation is reconciled or refunded, now keyed on the serving
    attempt rather than on the head candidate. A single-candidate plan takes the
    original path unchanged, so a plain model, an alias, and a one-target policy
    are byte-identical here. ``base_request_fields`` is the credential-free
    request payload each candidate's kwargs are built from; without it, only the
    prebuilt ``call_kwargs`` can be dispatched and no fallover is possible.
