"""Shared request scaffold for the pass-through provider routes.

The pass-through endpoints (audio, images, embeddings, moderations, rerank)
follow one scaffold: resolve the billed user, rate limit, resolve the provider
selector, reserve budget, call the provider, write a usage log, and reconcile
(success) or refund (failure) the reservation. :func:`run_passthrough` owns
that scaffold; each route supplies only its endpoint-specific pieces (budget
estimate, provider call, token extraction, cost computation) as callbacks.

Provider failures are classified with the same helper the hybrid fallback path
uses (``_classify_upstream_error``) and surface as HTTP 502: an upstream outage
is an upstream failure, not a gateway bug, matching the chat, messages, and
responses routes. The raw provider message is never included in the response
detail (it is preserved on the usage log's ``error_message``).

Every row this scaffold writes comes from one of two places: ``_usage_row`` for
the outcomes of an attempted provider call (success, provider error), and the
shared ``log_gateway_rejection`` for requests the gateway refused before ever
calling a provider, which the chat/messages/responses pipeline uses too so both
scaffolds record a rejection identically.

    Steps: resolve the billed user (honoring ``config.reject_user_mismatch``),
    rate limit, resolve the provider selector, look up pricing, reserve the
    estimated cost, invoke ``call_provider``, write the usage log, and
    reconcile (success) or refund (failure) the reservation.

    Args:
        endpoint: Path recorded on usage log rows (e.g. ``"/v1/embeddings"``).
        raw_request: Incoming request, used for rate limiting.
        response: When given, rate-limit headers are set on it. Routes that
            return their own response object pass ``None`` and read
            ``PassthroughOutcome.headers`` instead.
        auth_result: The ``verify_api_key_or_master_key`` dependency result.
        model: The raw request selector; used for the reservation and error
            text, while the resolved short name reaches the provider and logs.
        user: The request's ``user`` field, if any.
        call_provider: Awaits the provider call for the resolved selector. An
            ``HTTPException`` raised here (e.g. an upload size check) refunds
            the reservation and propagates unchanged.
        lookup_pricing: Whether to resolve :class:`ModelPricing` for the model.
            Audio resolves it for per-request charge lines but the reservation
            estimate stays 0 (no measurable cost unit yet, so no pre-call spend).
        pricing_use_defaults: Whether the pricing lookup may fall back to the
            genai-prices dataset. A route whose billable unit is not a token
            passes False for the reason :func:`find_model_pricing` documents:
            those rates are USD per million *tokens*, so a per-request route
            would charge them as USD per million *requests* and a per-image route
            as USD per image, writing a charge line at the wrong unit for a rate
            nobody configured.
        estimate: Maps the pricing row to the reservation estimate in USD.
            Defaults to 0.0, which still enforces per-user state (user exists,
            not blocked, not already over budget).
        enforce_require_pricing: When True and ``config.require_pricing`` is
            set, reject unpriced models with 402. The check runs after the
            reservation (so its 404/403 rejections take precedence) and the
            reservation is refunded before raising. Honored only on the
            resolve-first path: a ``reserve_before_resolve`` route resolves
            pricing after its reservation and skips this gate, so setting both
            silently serves an unpriced model. No route sets both today.
        usage_tokens: Maps the provider result to ``(prompt, completion,
            total)`` token counts for the usage log. Defaults to ``(0, 0, 0)``.
        compute_cost: Maps the result and pricing to the final USD cost, or
            ``None`` to leave the log's cost unset and reconcile at 0.0.
        compute_meters: Maps the result, pricing, and the cost ``compute_cost``
            just returned to this request's billing meters and charge lines, or
            ``None`` to leave both unset. Only called when ``compute_cost``
            returned a cost, so a route with no priced unit never needs to guard
            against a missing cost itself.
        map_provider_error: Route-specific provider-exception mapping checked
            before the generic 502 (the error log and refund happen either way).
        reserve_before_resolve: Preserve the audio routes' historical ordering,
            reserving budget before the selector is resolved. Routes that need
            pricing resolve first (the pricing key is the resolved instance).
        relabel: Rewrite the result's ``model`` field to the configured alias
            the caller used, so responses do not echo the aliased target.

    Returns:
        The provider result plus the resolved selector and rate-limit headers.
