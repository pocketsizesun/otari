"""Runtime routing-policy management.

A policy is a model name callers use, which decides which real model serves the
request, what is tried after a retryable failure, and which guardrails always run.
``config.yml`` policies are read-only here (they are validated at startup and live
in a file this process does not own); these routes manage the ``routing_policies``
table, which means the same thing to a request but can change without a restart.

Scoping matches ``/v1/aliases``: a stored policy is either global (``user_id``
omitted) or scoped to one user, who is then the only caller that resolves it. See
``services/policy_store`` for precedence between the layers.

Master-key gated on every verb, like alias management. That is what makes a policy
safe as a unit of access: only an operator can decide which models a name reaches,
so a caller cannot widen their own access by writing a policy.

    Accepts an unsaved ``spec`` as well as a saved ``name``, so a form can validate
    what the operator is about to save. The response includes dropped candidates
